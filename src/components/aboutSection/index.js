          I am Deepak Dutta, a full-stack JavaScript developer with around 4
          years of experience, specialising in React Native for building
          cross-platform mobile applications on Android and iOS. I have worked
          on mobile apps such as the Veera Health app, where I developed
          features like meal review with AI, product modules, and background
          notifications. I have also contributed to other apps, including a
          crypto wallet UI and a stealth project with advanced onboarding and
          reporting flows. 
          <br/>
          In addition to mobile, I have built web platforms
          like Iksana and Sarika Eyewear, focusing on performance and
          user-friendly design. My work mainly revolves around creating reliable
          applications and delivering solutions that work smoothly across
          devices.
